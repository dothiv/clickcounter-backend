# dotHIV ClickCounter Backend

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dothiv/clickcounter-backend.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dothiv/clickcounter-backend)

The Google App Engine cloud app that supports the Click Counter.

## Atomic nbd.put()


Data objects are modified in the handlers and then all the modifications are
sent to the storage together by NBD's put() method, which in itself is consistent.
See [Storing Data in Python](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/storage).


## IPv6 compatibility

[This means that all App Engine apps will become accessible over IPv6 to anyone participating in the program!](http://googleappengine.blogspot.de/2010/03/app-engine-joins-google-over-ipv6.html)


## Data storage comparision

See [Storing Data in Python](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/storage).

> Strongly consistent except when performing global queries.

> The App Engine Datastore offers a free quota with daily limits. Paid accounts offer unlimited storage, read, and write operations.
